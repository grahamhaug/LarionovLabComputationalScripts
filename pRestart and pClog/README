### Description ###
pRestart and pClog are intended to help with very long/expensive optimizations and, in particular, frequency calculations. 

pRestart allows you to restart frequency jobs which get held up in the time-consuming "generating vectors" section. 
Each iteration is numerically appended in a new .log, ex: "pRestart yourjob.log" will create and submit "yourjob2.log"

pClog (CombineLogs) is written to append each of these subjob.log files into one cumulative yourjob-full.log file which can then be processed via pLog/etc. 

Using these two in conjunction allows you to do two things:
1. Reliably restart very long/frequency jobs
2. Request less time for each job (ie: instead of requesting 12 hour skx jobs, you can request several 3 hours skx jobs and not be punished as much by skx queue waits) 

### Caveats ###
1. Using pRestart requires the use of a ReadWriteFile.rwf in your original calculation's route section, ie the line "%rwf":

%nproc=64
%mem=70gb
%rwf=/work/example/directory/yourjob.rwf
%NoSave
%chk=/work/example/directory/yourjob.chk
#p pw6b95d3/def2tzvp empiricaldispersion=gd3bj nosymm int=superfine opt=(tight) freq scrf=(solvent=acetonitrile,smd)

In this instance %NoSave is added to ensure that the rwf is deleted upon successful job completion (these files are very large). 

2. RWF's are very large and can take up a ton of disk space; appropriately deleting these upon either a) successful job completion (achieved via %NoSave) or
manually deleting the .rwf's (where applicable) should be a priority

3. pRestart can't handle every case - one (and I think the only) exception to its utility is in the case of TS "calcfc" calculations, wherein the "generating vectors" step
occurs upfront. In these instances, I've had mixed success restarting jobs stuck in the "calcfc" phase. 

### Use ###
pRestart is called with "pRestart yourjob.log" 

The script will determine if the requisite files necessary are present for a restart (yourjob.com, yourjob.rwf, yourjob.log) and report if anything is missing. 
if yourjob+1.com already exists (which would be the next iteration created by pRestart),
