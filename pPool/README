pPool is used for batch generation of G16 SBATCH scripts based on a common template: g16_SBATCH_template.txt

It can create a single SBATCH script for one job:
pPool example.com => option 1: "Single job"

Or can create multiple inputs at once:
1. Make the requisite input.com files (ex: job-conformer1.com .. job-conformer20.com)
2. Ensure all of the .com's are in the current working directory 
3. run pPool on the first one (ex: "pPool job-conformer1.com) and select option 2: "Range"
4. Enter the range of jobs to be run (ex: 1-20 for 20 .com's) - this can also be noncontiguous (ie: I have jobs 1-20 set up but only want 1-5,8-10; set the range "1-5,8-10")

pPool will then generate and sends SBATCH scripts/matching .com's to a common "queue directory" called "jobPool" from which they can be submitted manually
 (or eventually autonomously, via qManager)

*** INSTALL ***
1. place "pPool" script in your home/scripts directory 

2. chmod 755 pPool to make it executable 

3. add an alias for pPool to *both* your .bashrc and your .env environment list:
  alias pPool='/home1/your/home/scripts/pPool'
  
4. place "g16_SBATCH_template.txt" in your home/scripts directory

5. an alias for "fairshare" needs to be added to .bashrc and your .env file (allocations and -u are specific to your situation):
alias fairshare='sshare -a -A Mechanistic-Studies,Kinetics-of-selectiv,Computational-Analys,Excited-state-reacti,SOCI-Xmers -u rdg758'


### CONFIGURATION ###
1. in "g16_SBATCH_template.txt", make sure that the following points to your .env file (should be in home.../scripts or added to home../scripts:
  #point to alias env file
  source /home1/your/home/scripts/alii.env

2. in "pPool", several things need to be pointed to your relevant directory locations:

  a) Where to send the jobs after creation (you will submit from this directory) 
  ### SET jobPool DIRECTORY LOCATION ###
  jobPool=/work/your/working/directory/jobPool
  
  b) Source your .env file 
  #You will need to point this as where your scripts are
  source /home1/your/home/scripts/alii.env

  c) You may have different queues to use (instead of TACC's "Normal" or "SKX-Normal") 
  #In the function "makeSBATCH", edit the queue names:
  queueOptions=("Normal" "SKX-Normal")
   
   d) You may have different allocations, in which case several changes are necessary:
   #store the current allocations' fairshares
   fsKinetics=$(fairshare | awk 'FNR == 8 {print $7}')
   fsMech=$(fairshare | awk 'FNR == 10 {print $7}')
   fsComp=$(fairshare | awk 'FNR == 4 {print $7}')
   fsExcited=$(fairshare | awk 'FNR == 6 {print $7}')
   fsSOCI=$(fairshare | awk 'FNR == 12 {print $7}')

    #edit in your relevant allocations to this section of makeSBATCH function
    case $REPLY in
    1) #Kinetics-of-selectiv
        export ALLOCATION='Kinetics-of-selectiv'
        echo -e "${GREEN}Using allocation: ${CYAN}Kinetics-of-selectiv${NC}\n"
       break;;

    
3. pPool should now be configured for use.
