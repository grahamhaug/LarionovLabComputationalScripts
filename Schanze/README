There is a simple test job with a basic/bare bones SBATCH script in the RunThisJobFirst folder. 

1. Upload both files (using WINSCP) to a test folder in your work directory ("cdw" and then "mkdir yourfolder" to make the directory)
2. Run the testjob using "sbatch testjob"
3. Check that your job is running with "squeue -U yourusername"
4. A log file called "testjob.log" will be output to the current directory if the job completed
5. You can open the log file using ChemCraft
6. Refer to the ProgSI script in the book chapters I sent on how to extract thermodynamic info from the job
